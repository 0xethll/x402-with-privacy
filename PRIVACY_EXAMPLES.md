# Privacy-Preserving Payment Examples

This document explains how privacy-preserving payments protect sensitive data access.

## üîí Why Privacy Matters for Sensitive Data

Traditional blockchain payments are **completely transparent**. When you pay to access sensitive information, everyone can see:

1. **Payment Amount** ‚Üí Reveals how valuable the data is to you
2. **Timestamp** ‚Üí Reveals when you accessed sensitive information
3. **Frequency** ‚Üí Reveals patterns of your behavior
4. **Recipient** ‚Üí Reveals which services you're using

### Real-World Privacy Concerns

#### Example 1: Credit Score Access
**Without Privacy:**
```
Transaction: 0xabc123...
From: 0xAlice...
To: CreditBureau
Amount: 0.5 USD
```
‚ùå **Everyone can see**: Alice paid $0.50 to check her credit score
‚ùå **Inference**: She might be applying for a loan or worried about her credit
‚ùå **Risk**: Insurance companies, lenders could track this behavior

**With FHE Privacy:**
```
Transaction: 0xdef456...
From: 0xAlice...
To: CreditBureau
Amount: 0x7f8e9d... (encrypted)
```
‚úÖ **No one can see**: How much Alice paid
‚úÖ **Protected**: Her financial concerns remain private
‚úÖ **Secure**: Only the contract knows the actual amount

#### Example 2: Medical Records Access
**Without Privacy:**
```
Transaction: 0x789abc...
From: 0xBob...
To: HealthClinic
Amount: 1.0 USD
```
‚ùå **Everyone can see**: Bob paid $1 to access medical records
‚ùå **Inference**: He might have a health condition
‚ùå **Risk**: Health insurance discrimination, employment bias

**With FHE Privacy:**
```
Transaction: 0x123def...
From: 0xBob...
To: HealthClinic
Amount: 0xa1b2c3... (encrypted)
```
‚úÖ **No one can see**: What Bob paid for
‚úÖ **Protected**: His health information access is private
‚úÖ **Secure**: HIPAA-compliant privacy on-chain

### Key Privacy Features

1. **Client-Side Encryption**: Amount is encrypted with FHE before leaving the client
2. **Encrypted Signature**: EIP-712 signature includes encrypted handle, not plaintext
3. **On-Chain Privacy**: Contract receives and processes encrypted amounts
4. **Facilitator Decryption**: Only facilitator can decrypt the transfer result
5. **Zero-Knowledge Balance**: No one can see user's token balance

**Privacy Benefit:**
- Lenders can't track how often you check your credit
- Insurance companies can't see your credit monitoring habits
- Employers can't discriminate based on credit checks

---

### 2. Medical Records API
```http
GET /medical-records HTTP/1.1
X-PAYMENT: <base64-encoded-encrypted-payment>
```

**Use Cases:**
- Patient portals
- Telemedicine platforms
- Insurance claims
- Health research

**Privacy Benefit:**
- Insurance companies can't see which records you access
- Prevents health discrimination
- HIPAA-compliant privacy
- Protected against data brokers

## üíª Code Example

### Client: Encrypting Payment

```typescript
// Initialize FHE client
await initFHEVM();
const client = await createFHEVMClient({
  network: "sepolia",
  provider: RPC_URL,
});

// Encrypt payment amount
const { handle, proof } = await client.encrypt.uint64({
  value: 500000n, // 0.5 ConfidentialUSD
  contractAddress: CONFIDENTIAL_USD_ADDRESS,
  userAddress: wallet.address,
});

// Sign with encrypted handle (NOT plaintext!)
const signature = await wallet.signTypedData({
  domain,
  types,
  message: {
    from: wallet.address,
    to: server.address,
    encryptedValueHandle: handle, // ‚Üê Encrypted!
    validAfter,
    validBefore,
    nonce,
  },
});
```

### Facilitator: Settling Payment

```typescript
// Execute on-chain transfer with encrypted amount
const tx = await contract.write.transferWithAuthorization([
  from,
  to,
  encryptedValueHandle, // ‚Üê Still encrypted!
  inputProof,
  validAfter,
  validBefore,
  nonce,
  signature,
]);

// Wait for confirmation
const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash: tx });

// Decrypt the result (only facilitator can do this)
const transferred = await fhevmClient.decrypt({
  ciphertextHandle: receipt.logs[0].transferred,
  contractAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  walletClient: facilitatorWallet,
});

if (transferred === 0n) {
  // Insufficient balance (privacy preserved!)
}
```

## üåü Privacy Guarantees

### What is Hidden

‚úÖ Payment amount (encrypted with FHE)
‚úÖ User balance (encrypted with FHE)
‚úÖ Transfer amount (encrypted with FHE)
‚úÖ Settlement result (only facilitator can decrypt)

### What is Visible

‚ö†Ô∏è Transaction sender address
‚ö†Ô∏è Transaction recipient address
‚ö†Ô∏è Transaction timestamp
‚ö†Ô∏è Gas fees paid

### Trade-offs

- **Privacy**: Maximum - payment amounts completely hidden
- **Performance**: Slightly slower due to FHE operations
- **Cost**: Higher gas fees for FHE operations
- **Usability**: Requires FHE-enabled token contract
